## Who is behind Dandelbrot?

Hi there. I'm Dan Burrell. I work at the University of Southern Queensland where I lecture in statistics and act as a biometrician consultant to researchers in the Centre for Crop Health. 

## What is Dandelbrot?

Dandelbrot is my personal website and blog about all things mathematical, statistical and computational. Obviously the name stems from merging "Dan" with the famous "mandelbrot set" fractal, named after Benoit Mandelbrot, who coined the term "fractal" to describe the geometry of coastlines, snowflakes, mountains, trees and other aspects of nature that exhibit a kind of non-smooth self-similarity that is clearly visible in the mandelbrot set and other such mathematical objects. 


Thanks for reading!
