      <description>In the very small amount of spare time that I have available, I’ve been trying to bring myself up to speed with Bayesian statistical models and in particular statistical sampling methods. As such I was watching this talk by Iain Murray on probabilistic modelling and I saw him explain the basics of Monte Carlo integration using a simple toy example of estimating the value of \(\pi\). Mind you, he gave that particular slide the title “A dumb approximation of \(\pi\)” because there are far better ways to do it.</description>

      <description>I’m currently teaching a class on the statistical design of experiments, and we’re using SPSS as the statistical software to implement basic analyses of data from designed experiments at the moment. Shortly we’d like to switch to using R as the main statistical computing package. I also have a client who has asked me to teach her how to use R to perform basic one-way and two-way analysis of variance for data arising from completely randomised designs with single factor and 2-factorial treatment structures, respectively.</description>

      <description>I’m interested in uncertainty quantification. There is a brief article in SIAM NEWS from 2014 which I just read that has piqued my interest further. The article, authored by Marco Iglesias and Andrew Stuart, discusses uncertainty quantification (UQ) in the context of inverse problems from a Bayesian perspective. Let’s have a look at the basic ideas set out in the article to get a feel for this important and “exciting area of research in the mathematical sciences” that brings together skills and knowledge from “analysis, computation, probability, and statistics.</description>

      <title>The Mandelbrot set in R</title>

      <description>This being my first post to Dandelbrot.com, I thought it only fitting to post something about the Mandelbrot set. I determined to code up a mandelbrot set fractal generator in R. After a little digging I came across this R-bloggers post from 2014. I figured, rather than reinvent the wheel, I might as well just borrow code from here, with all due kudos to Myles Harrison, the original author.</description>
