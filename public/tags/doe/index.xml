      <description>I’m currently teaching a class on the statistical design of experiments, and we’re using SPSS as the statistical software to implement basic analyses of data from designed experiments at the moment. Shortly we’d like to switch to using R as the main statistical computing package. I also have a client who has asked me to teach her how to use R to perform basic one-way and two-way analysis of variance for data arising from completely randomised designs with single factor and 2-factorial treatment structures, respectively.</description>
