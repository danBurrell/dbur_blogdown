      <description>I’m currently teaching a class on the statistical design of experiments, and we’re using SPSS currently. Shortly we’d like to switch to using R as the main statistical computing package. I also have a client who has asked me to teach her how to use R to perform basic one-way and two-way analysis of variance for data arising from completely randomised designs with single factor and 2-factorial treatment structure. This is child’s play, especially in R, but I thought I’d take the opportunity to work through a couple of good examples and record them here for future use.</description>
